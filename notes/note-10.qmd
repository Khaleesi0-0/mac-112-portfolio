#### **Reshaping Data Overview:**

-   **Reshaping** data refers to changing the structure of a dataset, often moving between "wide" and "long" formats.

-   **Wide Format**: Data is spread out across more columns (e.g., multiple columns for different time periods or categories).

-   **Long Format**: Data is condensed into fewer columns, with multiple observations stacked in rows for the same categories or time periods.

### **Key Concepts in Reshaping:**

1.  **Units of Observation**:

    -   This refers to what each row in the dataset represents. When reshaping data, the units of observation can change.

    -   For example, raw data might contain individual penguin measurements, while reshaped data (via summarization) could represent species-level averages.

2.  **Information Loss**:

    -   Aggregating data (e.g., via `summarize()` after `group_by()`) can lead to information loss, as individual data points are reduced to summary statistics.

    -   Reshaping without aggregation (e.g., via `pivot_longer()` or `pivot_wider()`) generally preserves information, only changing how it is represented.

### **Wide vs Long Formats**:

-   **Wide Format**: Each row contains multiple values (e.g., average body mass of male and female penguins in separate columns).

    -   **Example**

        `penguin_avg |>    pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = avg_body_mass)`

-   **Long Format**: Multiple observations (e.g., male and female body mass) are stacked in rows under a single column for each category.

    -   **Example**:

        `penguin_avg_wide |>    pivot_longer(cols = c(female, male), names_to = "sex", values_to = "avg_body_mass")`
